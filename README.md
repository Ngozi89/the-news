# Development Plan

## Agile design

The development of the website has followed an Agile methodology, using GitHub's projects to prioritize and track user stories and features. The approach enabled the implementation of ideas based on their level of importance, ensuring that the website functionality and user experience were not compromised. The following categories were applied

- must have
- should have
- would have
- could have

![](readme/user-story.png)

![](readme/user-stories1.png)

# Design

## Design

The website is meant to have a simple layout and a clean design. The home page is aimed at giving a professional and informative impression.

### Colour Scheme

![Palette](readme/color.jpg)

The colour scheme is red and white to create a visually appealing and cohesive design that is easily recognizable as being associated to news website.

# Features

## Auth ([uac 1](#uac1))

Authentication is particularly important for user for wants to interact with posts as the subject is quite sensitive and people are vulnerable asking for help, so it should be confidential within the community and available only for authenticated users. Thus the website, besides the home page is a registration link for users to register

In a Django project, there are several ways to handle authentication and authorization. One of the most popular libraries [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), provides a flexible solution for handling user authentication and registration. It supports both traditional username and password authentication as well as social authentication through providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. It uses session-based authentication and stores user authentication information in the user's session, instead of Django's built-in token-based authentication. When a user logs in, the library creates a new session for the user and stores the user's identifying information (such as the user's ID or username) in the session. The library then sends a session ID to the client, as a session cookie, which the client stores in the browser. With each subsequent request, the client sends the session ID back to the server in the Cookie header of the HTTP request. django-allauth then uses the session ID to look up the associated session and authenticate the user.

One of the key features of [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is its support for OAuth. OAuth is an open standard for authorization that allows users to share their private resources stored on one site with another site, without having to share their credentials. OAuth allows users to grant a third-party application access to their resources without having to reveal their password. This is useful for scenarios where users want to give access to their resources to a third-party application without having to provide their credentials.

One of the main reasons I chose to use [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is because of its flexibility and support for various authentication methods. Another reason is because of its scalability. The library is built on top of the Django framework and it is actively maintained and widely used in production, which means that it is likely to be compatible with the latest Django versions and have a solid user base.

### User Authentication ([uac 6](#uac6))

![](readme/signup.png)

The project uses Django's built-in User model, which means that users can register and log in to the website with email, username. However, users will not be logged in automatically after resetting their password. The ACCOUNT_SESSION_REMEMBER is set to True which means that the session will be remembered even if the user closes the browser.

### Reset password ([uac 18](#uac18))

The website also provides a password reset feature, which is an important security feature that allows users to reset their password if they have forgotten it or if their account has been compromised.

## Responsive ([uac 1](#uac1))

News Mix website is designed with flexibility and aesthetic appeal in mind, ensuring that it is responsive and visually pleasing on all screen sizes and resolutions, starting at 350px.
Responsiveness was achieved by utilizing Bootstrap. This allowed for the rearrangement of page components to optimize the user experience on different screen sizes. Breakpoints were chosen based on typical device screen sizes and the goal of providing the best possible presentation of content for all screens. Breakpoints are not strictly consistent (\*particularly for smaller screens) but it is done intentionally to provide a better presentation of the content for all screens.

## Accessibility

The website is designed and developed with accessibility in mind: it provides alternative text for images, using semantic HTML elements, aria-labels and providing adequate colour contrast. Keyboard navigation is possible. It also works with screen readers, however, there's room for improvement in this aspect, to ensure that it is fully accessible to users with disabilities.

### Navbar ([uac 3](#uac3), [uac 4](#uac4))

![](readme/navbar.png)

The navbar is a key feature of the website, located at the top of the page. It also include links that aid navigation on the website. The "Registration" link provides form for new users to register and the login allows already registered users to login. The "Login" and "Register" links are used for user authentication and are only visible to unauthenticated users. Once the user logs in, they will not see these links anymore and "Log out" will be displayed instead.

### Comment field ([uac 16](#uac16))

![](readme/comment.png)

The form to leave a comment appears when the user opens post to read news details. It is handled by JavaScript without refreshing the page. This allows for a seamless and smooth user experience, as users can leave comments without disrupting their current browsing session.

It is important to note that all comments are moderated to ensure that the content is appropriate and relevant to the post. This helps to maintain a positive and respectful community and ensures that all users have a positive experience while using the website.

## Admin ([uac 5](#uac5))

![](readme/admin.png)

The website includes a fully customised Admin panel. The admin panel allows for the management and editing of the application's data through a web interface. This interface is only accessible to users with administrator or superuser privileges. The admin panel provides CRUD functionalities. It allows for the management of the content, users, groups, and permissions.

## Content Moderation ([uac 15](#uac15))

Content moderation is essential to ensure that the content is appropriate and does not violate any terms of service or community guidelines, protecting against spam or malicious content, and maintaining a positive user experience. In my project, content moderation is done for all posts and comments left on posts and is implemented by the admin users who have access to the admin panel where they can review and approve or reject comments. This helps to ensure that all the content is relevant, respectful and appropriate for the community.

## JS Bundling

JavaScript bundling is an optimization technique we can use to reduce the number of server requests for JavaScript files. Webpack is a JavaScript bundler that allows to package and optimize JavaScript code for production use. It takes multiple JavaScript files, and any other assets such as images or CSS, and creates a single bundle that can be loaded by the browser. This bundle includes all the code your application needs to run, and it can also optimize the code for faster load times and better performance.

In the project before bundling the code was compiled with Babel, a JavaScript transpiler that allows to write modern JS code and then converting it to a version that is compatible with older browsers. For this reason, the main JS file that handles Django app was also bundled.

## **Feature considerations**

1. Reply comment section so that users can interact with each other and engange more on the post.

2. Deleting comment and editing comment so users can leave only what they want to be on a post.

3. Translation, so that users can translate to their prefared language.

4. Reporting undesirable content.
Buttons for reporting undesirable content on a website will allow users to quickly and easily flag content that they believe is inappropriate, offensive, or violative of the website's terms of service. This allows website administrators to quickly identify and remove such content, keeping the website safe and enjoyable for all users. Additionally, reporting buttons can help to create a sense of community and shared responsibility among users, encouraging them to take an active role in maintaining the website's standards and quality.

5. Buttons to share posts on social media.
Buttons that provide the ability for users to share content on social media allow for an increase in the reach and visibility of the content. This can lead to more traffic to the website and ultimately more engagement. The buttons make it easy for users to share content with their friends and followers on social media.
When content is shared on social media, it includes a link back to the website. This can help with branding, as it increases the visibility of the website and its content, increasing positive impact.

This project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku and the steps for deployment are as followed:

### First step

- Sign in to Heroku app
- Create a new app with a unique name

#### Step 2 Database

- Create account on ElephantSQL.com and create new instance
- Select a plan name and choose tine turtle (free)
- Select region and review to make sure everthing is setup correctly
- Click create instance at the down right side of your windown.
- Click on the database you just created and cope the URL
- On the IDE in codeanywhere create a file env.py, tehn import os and create os.environ with DATABASE.URL variable and set the copied url from as the value.
- Create another os.enviro and set the variable SECRET_KEY and create your sectret key

#### Step 3

- Open setting.py and import os at the top then add the database url, add the env.py file, scroll down and change the secret key value to os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
- Make sure the env.py file is on gitignore so it won't be commited to github.
- You can use git status to check which files that will be commited to github and make sure the env.py file is not amoung.
- Comment out the existing DATABASE on setting.py and create another Database and set it to
     'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))

#### Step 4

- When this is done migrate to see everthing is okay, then return to Heroku and
- Go to setting and reveal _Config Var_. Add a new key clalled DATABASE_ URL and the value will be the copied url database created earlier.
- Add another config var key SECRET_KEY and paste the secret key that's added on the env'py file.
- To improve compatibility with various Python libraries add anothe config var PORT and the value set to 8000

#### Step 5

- Create a free Cloudinary account.
- Go to your dashboard and cope the API Enviroment Variable. This is used to connect the app to Cloudinary.
- Add another os.enviro on env.py file and add the CLOUDINARY_URL and the vlaue is the API Enviroment Variable copied from Cloudinary.
- Go back to Heroku and add another config var key and paste the Cloudinary api.

### Second step

- Click on deploy at the top left side and select github to connect to github. Confirm your connection to github and search for the github repository name, click connect to link up the Heroku app creacted ealier with the repository.
- Choose either automatic deploy or manual. I used manual which is deploy branch.
- Allow the app to build until it shows successful then click view and it takes you to the deployed link.
